## Introduction

> üõà This project currently depends on features in daily builds of the .NET
`6.0.100-rc.1` SDK and requires preview builds of Visual Studio 2022 for IDE
support.
>
> To work with this sample directly from source with Visual Studio Code, run
`build.ps1` and then `startvscode.cmd` or `startvscode.sh`.

This sample project demonstrates techniques you can use for integration testing
an ASP.NET Core 6 web application that uses the new [minimal APIs] feature.

[minimal APIs]: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-6-preview-4/#introducing-minimal-apis

The system-under-test used by the sample implements a simple Todo list
application with ASP.NET Core 6 using the following technologies:

* [Minimal APIs]
* [EFCore] with [SQLite]
* [GitHub OAuth] authentication
* [Razor Pages]
* [TypeScript]

[EFCore]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/
[GitHub OAuth]: https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers/blob/dev/docs/github.md
[Razor Pages]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/
[SQLite]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/sqlite/
[TypeScript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-oop.html

The tests show how you can write integration tests for the [API] and [User
Interface] layers of an application that can help you get good coverage of the
system-under-test, as well as confidence that the changes you make to an
application are ready to ship to a production system.

The tests include demonstrations of the use of the following open source
libraries and technologies:

* [coverlet]
* [HttpClientFactory]
* [HttpClient Interception]
* [Playwright]
* [ReportGenerator]
* [Shouldly]
* [WebApplicationFactory&lt;T&gt;]
* [xunit]
* [xunit Logging]

## Debugging

To debug the application locally outside of the integration tests, you will need
to [create a GitHub OAuth app] to obtain secrets for the `GitHub:ClientId` and
`GitHub:ClientSecret` [options] so that the [OAuth user authentication] works and
you can log into the Todo App UI.

When creating the GitHub OAuth app, use `https://localhost:5001/signin-github`
as the _Authorization callback URL_.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not commit GitHub OAuth secrets to source control. Configure them
with [User Secrets] instead.

[create a GitHub OAuth app]: https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app
[OAuth user authentication]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio
[options]: https://github.com/martincostello/dotnet-minimal-api-integration-testing/blob/1cd99029a9e3af57ab2fe1335b43e298efb65c09/src/TodoApp/appsettings.json#L10-L11
[User Secrets]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets

## Building and Testing

Compiling the application yourself requires Git and the
[.NET SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core "Download the .NET SDK")
to be installed (version `6.0.100` or later).

To build and test the application locally from a terminal/command-line, run the
following set of commands:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/martincostello/dotnet-minimal-api-integration-testing.git
cd dotnet-minimal-api-integration-testing
./build.ps1
```
